# Claims File Correction Workbench (Step 2)

This project is the **Step 2** module for Claims iQ Core:
Core detects issues in claim PDFs and returns structured JSON. This workbench loads the PDF + issue bundle, then enables:

- Auto-correction (with approvals where required)
- Human-in-the-loop editing
- Audit logging
- Version-safe document handling

The PDF UI is built on **Nutrient Web SDK** with **Document Engine** for server-backed editing and persistence.

## Core principles

1. Never overwrite the original document.
2. Human approval required for irreversible actions.
3. Full audit trail for every correction.
4. Prefer true content edits; fall back safely.
